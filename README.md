ML model Deployment using Flask
This is model deployment repository where i have used flask and deployed MACHINE LEARNING model.
 ### Flask
 Flask is a web framework for Python, meaning that it provides functionality for building web applications, including managing HTTP requests and rendering templates. In this section, we will create a basic Flask application. In later sections, we'll add to this application to create our API.
In this project, i made flask app sample and also made Flask ML api which can be use.
